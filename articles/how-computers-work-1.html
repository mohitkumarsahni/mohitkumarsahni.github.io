                Computers have become an integral part of everyday life, seamlessly woven into how we work, communicate, and even relax.
                But what exactly is a computer, and how did these remarkable machines come to be?
            </p>

            <h2>üîπ What Is a Computer?</h2>
            <p>
                A computer is an electronic device that accepts input, processes data according to instructions, and delivers output.
                At its core, a computer helps us solve problems, from simple calculations to managing global communication networks.
            </p>

            <h2>üîπ Everyday Computers</h2>
            <p>
                When most people hear "computer," they picture a desktop or laptop. But computers come in many forms:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Smartphones and tablets</li>
                <li>Gaming consoles</li>
                <li>Embedded systems (like those in cars and appliances)</li>
                <li>Servers powering the internet</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>üîπ A Brief History of Computing</h2>
            <p>
                The concept of automated computation dates back centuries.
                Ancient civilizations used tools like the abacus to simplify arithmetic.
                In the 19th century, inventors such as Charles Babbage dreamed of mechanical "analytical engines," laying the groundwork for modern computers.
            </p>
            <p>
                It wasn‚Äôt until the mid-20th century that true electronic computers emerged, with machines like ENIAC and UNIVAC.
                These early computers were massive, occupying whole rooms, and had limited power compared to today‚Äôs pocket-sized devices.
                Over time, advances in electronics and microprocessors led to personal computers, laptops, and the digital world we now depend on.
            </p>

            <h2>üîπ Main Components of a Computer</h2>
            <p>Understanding a computer requires getting familiar with its major parts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Hardware</b>: The physical parts you can touch‚Äîlike the keyboard, screen, motherboard, CPU (central processing unit), RAM (memory), and storage drives.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Software</b>: The instructions and programs that tell the hardware what to do. Common types include operating systems (like Windows or macOS) and applications (like web browsers or word processors).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Input/Output Devices</b>: Tools that let us interact with computers, such as keyboards, mice, microphones (input), and monitors, printers, speakers (output).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <table style="width:100%; text-align: left;">
                <tr>
                    <th>Component</th>
                    <th>Role</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Hardware</td>
                    <td>Executes physical operations and tasks</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Software</td>
                    <td>Provides instructions and user interface</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Input Devices</td>
                    <td>Allow data entry (keyboard, mouse)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Output Devices</td>
                    <td>Present results (monitor, printer, audio)</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
