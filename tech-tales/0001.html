            I was in 3rd year of my engineering when I got introduced to Docker. It was a great lecture but what I enjoyed was the practical use.
            Back then, I had joined a crash course about Big Data in college. It was a wonderful experience & I got to learn many new things from Back-End to Front-End to DevOps. Docker or, I would say Containerization was one of those technologies.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
            It was the time when I was learning and messing up my machine. I used to mess up my machine with all the dependencies installed. The painful part was uninstalling and cleaning the system, which gave me trouble.
            Sometimes the problem used to be in the root directories or other necessary dependencies uninstalled. And then in my life entered Docker.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
            I got introduced to Virtualization first & how Virtual Machines used to rule the deployment world and post that the topic of Containerization. I was lucky that I got introduced like this & got to understand better how the technology and the usage changed from Virtual Machines to Containers.
            Since then, I have seen many tutorials, courses, discussions & talks on YouTube or in the organizations over Docker. But only a few of them talked about why Docker became so popular.
        </p>
        <h2 style="color: #000; margin-block-start: 0; margin-block-end: 0;">A little dive in history.</h2>
        <p class="card-text">
            It all started with the "chroot" in 1979. The functionality was to change the parent root directory for the currently running process & its respective children processes. Since it loses the correct root directory, it can not identify or access the files from it. And due to this, the user or the group becomes isolated from the rest of the system.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
            After this came the Linux Namespaces in 2002 as part of Linux Kernel. It provided you with the functionality of partitioning the kernel resources so that one set of the process sees one set of resources & another set of the process sees another set of resources. It later became a very significant aspect of "containers" on Linux.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
            Post this in 2008, "Cgroups" was introduced in Linux Kernel to isolate the resource usage of a group of processes. Cgroups underwent many changes over the years. But always kept its original purpose, which is to provide a unified interface for process isolation in the Linux kernel.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
            In the same year, 2008 was introduced the LXC in Linux Kernel. LXC relied upon the Linux Kernel's Cgroups & Namespaces for providing a method for running multiple isolated Linux systems (containers) on a control host using a single Linux kernel.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
            After the LXC's merge in Linux Kernel, there were several container tools introduced. Some of them used LXC under the hood & some developed as a complete alternative to the LXC example Systemd-Nspawn.
        </p>
        <h2>Problems.</h2>
        <p class="card-text">
            One feature that these tools lack to provide was the ease of portability. One could use a workaround by extracting an archive of the entire root file system or by creating a snapshot of the file system, but for this, you need to have some automation and distribution experience too.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
            Also, one needs to create a root file system for chroot & bind mount parts of the host system in read-only mode.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
            Docker did not only solved the portability issue but also provided the ease of transferring and reuse of its packages.
        </p>
        <h2>Docker.</h2>
        <p class="card-text">
            Developed by dotCloud Inc. in 2013, Docker can package the application & dependencies in a virtual container which one can share in the form of an image(Docker Image) and can be used further with a simple command. Docker also built a Docker Hub(Docker Registry) to host all the Docker Images with Public and Private access.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
            Docker provided this ease of portability that anyone in the world could create a Docker Image & anyone else could use it on any machine.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
            In the initial days, Docker used LXC as the default execution environment. After one year of its debut, the libcontainer replaced the LXC as the default execution environment, which was written in the Go Programming language.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
            I have met many people who have made Docker a synonym to Containers. Docker did not invent or create the containers also Docker is not Container. The concept of Containerization or, I would say Operating-System-Level Virtualization is very old however Docker made it easy to use and simple to understand.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
            And that's what is special about it.
